# Overview

This project is is a small lander game, made with unity.
The main thing is that the player navigate in a 2D world, which is a slice of a planet.
And it is possible to rotate this slice, to explore different parts of the planet the player is on.

This project was also used to experiment a bit with post processing, for a wireframe effect that only appears in dark areas.

Here are some screenshots of the game :
